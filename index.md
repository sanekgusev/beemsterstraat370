# The Apartment

We're renting out our fully furnished lovely little apartment that we purchased back when we were living in Amsterdam. Located in the laidback Amsterdam Noord neighborhood, with parks, schools and shopping malls within walking distance, it's far enough from the hustle and bustle of Amsterdam's touristic city center, yet still well-connected to the Amsterdam Centraal station and the city.

It's a single bedroom-turned-1.5-bedroom apartment that has a brand new corner kitchen in the living room. We did some remodeling and turned what was previously a kitchen into a second, smaller, bedroom, which could serve as a small home office or a nice kids' bedroom (our 5-year old loved it!).

Our apartment has separate toilet and bathroom, and there's a huge storage room downstairs for all your bicycles and whatnot.

A picture is worth a thousand words. If you haven't already, take a look at the [photos]({{ site.url }}/photos/)!
