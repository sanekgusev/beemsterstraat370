# The Apartment

We're renting out our fully furnished lovely little apartment. Located in the laidback Amsterdam Noord neighborhood, with parks, schools and shopping malls within walking distance, it's far enough from the hustle and bustle of Amsterdam's touristic city center, yet still well-connected to the Amsterdam Centraal station and the city.

It's a single bedroom-turned-1.5-bedroom apartment with a brand new corner kitchen in the living room. In addition to the master bedroom there's also a second, smaller, bedroom, which could serve as a small home office or a kids' bedroom (our 5-year old loved it!).

Our apartment has separate toilet and bathroom, and there's a huge storage room downstairs for all your bicycles and whatnot.

A picture is worth a thousand words. If you haven't already, take a look at the [photos]({{ site.url }}/photos/)!

# House Rules

Families with children of any age are welcome, but pets are not. 

Absolutely no smoking of any kind within the apartment, but smoking on the balcony is fine with us.

Anything involving drilling holes in walls or any other not easily revertible alterations should be first discussed with us and would be at our discretion. 

You are free to move furniture around, move it away into storage area, or buy new stuff. Your stuff remains yours, unless we explicitly agree otherwise. Feel free to use anything that is in the apartment.

We generally expect you to handle trivial home repairs on your own (dead lightbulbs, broken hooks, etc.). We will reimburse the costs of any major repairs that you will have to make (washer, kitchen appliances, plumbing), as long as you can provide some sort of receipt for the work that was made.

You are responsible for arranging (and paying for) gas/electricity, water supply, internet, TV service, etc. This also means canceling these subscriptions when moving out.

Finally, we'd __really__ appreciate it if you would treat our place nice and clean, just like we did.

# Process

Since we're not physically present in Amsterdam, we will do the whole process electronically, by email. 

We'll want to do a quick chat with you on Skype/Hangouts (or phone, if all else fails) to get to know you before signing the rental agreement, and the agreement itself will be signed electronically and sent by email. You should be fine using that to register yourself at our address in the municipality. We'll also want to see your employment contract or a standard statement from your employer, as well as copies of your residence cards or passports.

# Owners

We're a small family of three, we've lived in Amsterdam for 2 years (from 2014 till 2016) because of myself working there — first at Booking.com and later at ING Bank. We have since moved to Pittsburgh, United States and this is where we live right now.
