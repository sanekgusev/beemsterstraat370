### A note about timezones

Please note that we're living in UTC-04:00, and Amsterdam is UTC+02:00, i. e., we're 6 hours behind. For that reason, please try calling in the afternoon, after 2 PM Amsterdam time. Correspondingly, please allow a bit more time for answering your emails.

# Apartment Viewings

We're still in the process of figuring out how best to arrange apartment viewings. Most likely, we'll coordinate this with current tenants or with one of our neighbors.
