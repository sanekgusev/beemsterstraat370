### A note about timezones

Please note that we're living in UTC-07:00, and Amsterdam is UTC+02:00, i. e., we're 9 hours behind. For that reason, calling works best in the evening, after 5 PM Amsterdam time. Correspondingly, please allow a bit more time for answering your emails.

# Apartment Viewings

To arrange for apartment viewing, get in touch with me using one of the ways mentioned above. Generally, expect the apartment to be likely available for viewings on weekday evenings and on weekends depending on current tenant availability.
